# Reinforcement Learning for Long-Term Robustness of Mean-Reversion Strategies

This project investigates whether standard reinforcement learning agents (e.g., PPO) can improve the long-term performance of mean-reversion-based trading strategies over volatile market regimes. The performance is manily measured by Sharpe ratio and drawdown.
